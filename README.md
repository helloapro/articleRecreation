# _Article Recreation_

#### _Recreation of an article in Mark Down for format learning purposes, May 2nd, 2016_

#### By _**April Peng (full project) & Dan Schafer (README portion)**_

## README practice

_The purpose of this is to get additional practice in git stuffs - creating and initiating pairs, cloning a doc from github, adding a README to a prior project (which actually I had already done so that I could see the formatting of the article recreation on the github face. I had to change that one to READMEformer.md)_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _First you set up your pairs with initials and email addresses_
* _Then you clone your intended folder from github_
* _Change into the cloned folder_
* _Make sure all your prior changes are in the git log_
* _Make sure you do remove -v to set origin_
* _Initiate your pair_
* _Create your README.md in the folder_
* _git-pair-commit your creation and other changes_

_Make sure you do all this in .md so that it's a nice, readable preview in github. Use Daring Fireball and dillinger.io in your web browsers for the actual article recreation!_

## Known Bugs

_Damn, I dunno any at this point!_

## Support and contact details

_You can email me at helloaprilpeng@gmail.com. Don't bother Dan because he's just an onlooker here. Contact him for moral support!_

## Technologies used

_Markdown, Atom, Github, Terminal, Chrome browser_
